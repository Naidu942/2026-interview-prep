## 1. Two Sum - Easy
**Pattern:** Hash Map / Two Pointers

Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target

Example: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 → Output: [0,1]

## 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Medium
**Pattern:** Sliding Window

Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters

Example: s = "abcabcbb" → Output: 3 (substring "abc")

## 3. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal - Medium
**Pattern:** BFS / Queue

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values

Example: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] → Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]


## 4. Coin Change - Medium
**Pattern:** Dynamic Programming

Given coins of different denominations and a total amount, find the minimum number of coins needed

Example: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 → Output: 3 (5+5+1)

## 5. Trapping Rain Water - Hard
**Pattern:** Two Pointers / Stack

Given elevation map represented by an array, calculate how much rainwater can be trapped
Example: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] → Output: 6
